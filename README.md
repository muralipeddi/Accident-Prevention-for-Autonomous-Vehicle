1) The use of autonomous vehicles has skyrocketed in the modern period. From past few years, automation had created and utilized in a wide range of industries. Many industry tasks do not require human help; therefore, automating these tasks will save a significant amount of time and human effort. This self-driving vehicle will save time and it also reduces human effort and human labor. 
2) However, autonomous vehicles face challenges such as avoiding collisions with obstacles and course planning. These two concerns must be addressed in order to make our autonomous vehicle function properly. Autonomous vehicles can travel from one location to another without the need for human effort. These vehicles should have three distinct characteristics, one is the obstacle avoidance feature, which prevents the robot from collisions with obstacles, the other is the lane detection feature, and the last is the traffic sign detection feature. 
3) Whenever an obstacle appears in front of the vehicle, it will avoid collision with the obstacle and continues its journey. Whenever the robot detects the lane, it will move away from it. Lanes are treated as boundaries by the vehicle and it always travels within these boundaries. So, these lanes act as a guided path for the vehicle. Different sensors should be used to achieve these features. 
4) To avoid a collision between the vehicle and the obstacle, the vehicle must first recognize the obstruction. We can do this by using an ultrasonic sensor that can detect any barrier in front of it.  
5) We can utilize infrared sensors to detect lanes or boundaries. IR sensors can detect white lanes on roads which helps the vehicle to be on road without getting off the road. These IR sensors also detect obstacles coming from sideways of the vehicle. 
6) This design helps us to travel from one place to another place in a single-lane road and helps us in preventing accidents. IR sensors can be used to detect the white lanes on black roads as IR sensors can differentiate black and white colours. But these IR sensors cannot be used for lane detection during the night times. This project only deals with accident prevention from collisions/crashes  using Ultrasonic and IR sensors.
